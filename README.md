# Twilio SMS Cost Calculator

A very simple tool to calculate costs for inbound/outbound SMS and line rental on a per country basis. 

- `On/Off` - When switched on, one line rental charge for that country is added to the total
- `Outbound texts` - Number of texts sent out from the rented number
- `Inbound texts` - Number of texts received to the rented number

## To Do
- Calculate cost with multiple line rentals
- Dynamically fetch Twilio pricing data (rather than hard storing)
- Add more countries
